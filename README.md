# Aethernet

This is a java implementation of [SHTU CS120 Computer Networks Course Project](https://sist-cs120.github.io/project-doc/) 3 and 4.

The implementation of acoustic link is migrated from the other repo [AcousticNFC](https://github.com/Mysterious-Mus/AcousticNFC), which is an implementation of project 1 and 2 of the course.

## Functionalities

In general, once launched, a process serving as the bridge between the acoustic link and the network will be started. The process will listen to the acoustic link and forward the received data to the network, and vice versa, enabling some network functionalities over the acoustic link.

For detailed functionalities, please refer to the **performance accessment** part of each task listed in the [project documentation](https://sist-cs120.github.io/project-doc/).

## Setup

We don't recommend setting up aethernet on your own, as it requires a lot of hardware and software dependencies, and all the parameters may have to be tuned accourding to your settings. This repo is made public for the purpose of limited reference.
